# OHStars

Notebooks and scripts for orbital analysis of Monty et al. (In prep)

## Notebook 1 - Sample Data

Shows how Gaia data can be sampled taking into account covariances in the data.

Render this notebook on [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamesmlane/OHStars/blob/master/notebooks/1-sample_gaia_data/sample_gaia_data.ipynb)

## Notebook 2 - Orbital Elements

Use the sampled Gaia data to calculate the orbital properties of the stars and determine their errors using Monte Carlo sampling.

## Notebook 3 - Orbit Plots

Make plots of the orbits from 5 Gyr into the past to 5 Gyr into the future. Show the orbits in the X-Y and R-Z planes.

## Notebook 4 - SB02 Sample Kinematics

Derive kinematics for SB02 sample. Plot Actions and try to associated with dGal mergers

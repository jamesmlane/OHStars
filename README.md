# OHStars

Notebooks and scripts for orbital analysis of Monty et al. (In prep)

## Notebook 1 - Sample Data

Shows how Gaia data can be sampled taking into account covariances in the data.

## Notebook 2 - Orbital Elements

Use the sampled Gaia data to calculate the orbital properties of the stars and determine their errors using Monte Carlo sampling.

## Notebook 3 - Orbit Plots

Make plots of the orbits from 5 Gyr into the past to 5 Gyr into the future. Show the orbits in the X-Y and R-Z planes.
